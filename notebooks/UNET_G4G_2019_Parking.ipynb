The key step is sampling the array image at points, to get all the pixels in a 256x256 neighborhood at each point.  It's worth noting that to build the training and testing data for the FCNN, you export a single TFRecord file that contains patches of pixel values in each record.  You do NOT need to export each training/testing patch to a different image.  Since each record potentially contains a lot of data (especially with big patches or many input bands), some manual sharding of the computation is necessary to avoid the `computed value too large` error.

The U-Net model takes 256x256 pixel patches as input and outputs per-pixel class probability, label or a continuous output.  We can implement the model essentially unmodified, but will use mean squared error loss on the sigmoidal output since we are treating this as a regression problem, rather than a classification problem.  Since impervious surface fraction is constrained to [0,1], with many values close to zero or one, a saturating activation function is suitable here."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Xh2EZyyPu84H","colab_type":"text"},"source":["##Metrics"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"mISCOXUHu7G_","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["def weighted_bce(y_true, y_pred):\n","  bce = tf.nn.weighted_cross_entropy_with_logits(labels = y_true, logits = y_pred, pos_weight = 20)\n","  return tf.reduce_mean(bce)\n","\n","def iou(true, pred):\n","\n","    intersection = true * pred\n","\n","    notTrue = 1 - true\n","    union = true + (notTrue * pred)\n","\n","    return tf.reduce_sum(intersection)/tf.reduce_sum(union)\n","\n"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"wsnnnz56yS3l","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["from tensorflow.python.keras import layers\n","from tensorflow.python.keras import losses\n","from tensorflow.python.keras import models\n","from tensorflow.python.keras import metrics\n","from tensorflow.python.keras import optimizers\n","\n","def conv_block(input_tensor, num_filters):\n","\tencoder = layers.Conv2D(num_filters, (3, 3), padding='same')(input_tensor)\n","\tencoder = layers.BatchNormalization()(encoder)\n","\tencoder = layers.Activation('relu')(encoder)\n","\tencoder = layers.Conv2D(num_filters, (3, 3), padding='same')(encoder)\n","\tencoder = layers.BatchNormalization()(encoder)\n","\tencoder = layers.Activation('relu')(encoder)\n","\treturn encoder\n","\n","def encoder_block(input_tensor, num_filters):\n","\tencoder = conv_block(input_tensor, num_filters)\n","\tencoder_pool = layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2), strides=(2, 2))(encoder)\n","\treturn encoder_pool, encoder\n","\n","def decoder_block(input_tensor, concat_tensor, num_filters):\n","\tdecoder = layers.Conv2DTranspose(num_filters, (2, 2), strides=(2, 2), padding='same')(input_tensor)\n","\tdecoder = layers.concatenate([concat_tensor, decoder], axis=-1)\n","\tdecoder = layers.BatchNormalization()(decoder)\n","\tdecoder = layers.Activation('relu')(decoder)\n","\tdecoder = layers.Conv2D(num_filters, (3, 3), padding='same')(decoder)\n","\tdecoder = layers.BatchNormalization()(decoder)\n","\tdecoder = layers.Activation('relu')(decoder)\n","\tdecoder = layers.Conv2D(num_filters, (3, 3), padding='same')(decoder)\n","\tdecoder = layers.BatchNormalization()(decoder)\n","\tdecoder = layers.Activation('relu')(decoder)\n","\treturn decoder\n","\n","def get_model():\n","\tinputs = layers.Input(shape=[None, None, len(BANDS)]) # 256\n","\tencoder0_pool, encoder0 = encoder_block(inputs, 32) # 128\n","\tencoder1_pool, encoder1 = encoder_block(encoder0_pool, 64) # 64\n","\tencoder2_pool, encoder2 = encoder_block(encoder1_pool, 128) # 32\n","\tencoder3_pool, encoder3 = encoder_block(encoder2_pool, 256) # 16\n","\tencoder4_pool, encoder4 = encoder_block(encoder3_pool, 512) # 8\n","\tcenter = conv_block(encoder4_pool, 1024) # center\n","\tdecoder4 = decoder_block(center, encoder4, 512) # 16\n","\tdecoder3 = decoder_block(decoder4, encoder3, 256) # 32\n","\tdecoder2 = decoder_block(decoder3, encoder2, 128) # 64\n","\tdecoder1 = decoder_block(decoder2, encoder1, 64) # 128\n","\tdecoder0 = decoder_block(decoder1, encoder0, 32) # 256\n","\toutputs = layers.Conv2D(1, (1, 1), activation='sigmoid')(decoder0)\n","\n","\tmodel = models.Model(inputs=[inputs], outputs=[outputs])\n","\n","\tmodel.compile(\n","\t\toptimizer=OPTIMIZER, \n","    loss = weighted_bce,\n","\t\t#loss=losses.get(LOSS),\n","\t\tmetrics=[metrics.get(metric) for metric in METRICS])\n","\n","\treturn model\n","\n","\n","log_dir = 'drive/My Drive/Tensorflow/models/UNET256'\n","\n","checkpoint = tf.keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint(\n","    log_dir+'best_weights.hdf5',\n","    monitor='val_mean_io_u',\n","    verbose=1,\n","    save_best_only=True,\n","    mode='max'\n","    )"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"uu_E7OTDBCoS","colab_type":"text"},"source":["# Training the model\n","\n","You train a Keras model by calling `.fit()` on it.
